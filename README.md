# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains the files for the Portfolio task for COMP2200/6200 in S2 2021. 
The repository contains 3 portfolio's, namely:-
Analysis of Cycling Data, 
Sports Vouchers program analysis, and
Mobile customer churn

Explanation of Portfolio's

Analysis of Cycling Data:-
This portfolio contains four files that contain cyclist data activities of four rides taken by the rider in 2016 and 2019.
In 2016 two rides were taken by the rider namely road race represented as rr_2016 and time trial represented as tt_2016 on a set course. And similarly both the rides were taken in the year 2019 as well. These datasets have information like speed, power, heart rate, distance traveled by the rider, etc. In road races, the rider rides with a peleton. As the races were on the set course the only difference between the two races was that road races included 2 laps whereas the time trial included only 1 lap. 
General exploring is done in this portfolio. The focus of this portfolio was to explore the data and understand if we can get information efficiently and effectively using pandas in python.
This portfolio will provide us with the total analysis of the dataset like what was the average and total speed in all rides, what was the range of speed in each ride, which ride was faster. All such data exploring in this portfolio.


Sports Vouchers Program Analysis:-
This portfolio contains 2 files with information about the sports program which provides up to a $100 voucher to kids so that they can participate in organized sports. So, the sportsvouchersclaimed dataset contains information on participants who redeemed the voucher since 2015. And another dataset namely, ABS_SEIFA_LGA shows a few measures of Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage for every Local Government Area. This portfolio expects us to explore the data and communicate useful insights from it. So, this portfolio depicts useful insights like which is the most popular sport and in which LGA, which LGA's are under and over-represented, and what's the relation between SEIFA and Vouchersclaimed dataset. In addition, this portfolio also contains a challenge task for further exploration which is exploring the Queensland dataset. So, there is a similar program in Queensland as well and the dataset is from the year 2015 named as round1-redeemed_get_started_vouchers. So, similar exploring is done with this dataset as well. In addition, a comparison has been drawn between South Australia and Queensland voucher datasets.



Mobile Customer Churn:-
This portfolio contains the Churn dataset where the customer leaves the service provider. So, the task in this portfolio is to create a predictive model to predict the churn from available features. To complete this task a little bit of data exploring has been done with the dataset which provides us with the information in it. Later, a Logistic Regression model is created to predict churn on train and test datasets. Confusion matrix and RFE model are also created to summarize the performance of a classification algorithm and to rank the features from most important to least in our model.
